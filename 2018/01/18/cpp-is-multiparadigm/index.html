  <p>C++ is a multiparadigm programming langrage.</p>
<p>Instead of regarding <code>C++</code> as a single language, we'd better treat it as a federation of related languages, where rules within a particular sublanguage tend to be simple and straightforward, while rules between sublanguages may change.</p>
<p>Basically, there are four primary sublanguages:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>C</code>: Based on ideas of blocks, statements, the preprocessor, built-in data types, arrays, pointers, etc, rules of C style C++ are simple: no templates, no exceptions, no overloading, etc.</li>
<li><code>Object-Oriented C++</code>: Based on ideas of classes(including constructors and destructors), encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, virtual functions(dynamic binding), etc, style of this part of C++ goes with the classic Object-Oriented design rules.</li>
<li><code>Template C++</code>: this is generic programming part of C++, where template considerations pervade C++. Due to its great power, templates give rise to a completely new programming paradigm, <em>template metaprogramming(TMP, item 48)</em>.</li>
<li><code>The STL</code>: With beautifully meshing conventions of containers, iterators, algorithms and function objects, the STL is a very special template library and has its particular ways of doing things.</li>
</ol>
<p>There's an interesting comparison among the four sublanguages: pass-by-value is generally preferred to pass-by-reference for built-in (i.e., <code>C-style</code>) types in favor of its higher efficiency, but for <code>Object-Oriented C++</code> pass-by-reference will usually be better due to the consideration of user-defined constructors and destructors; pass-by-reference is especially the dominant usecase in <code>template C++</code> for you don't even know the type of object you're dealing with; however, the old C pass-by-value rule applies to the case of <code>STL</code>, because iterators and function objects are modeled on pointers in C (see item 20).</p>
<p>In summary, rules for effective C++ programming vary, depending on the part of C++ you are using.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P.S.: Today I found that the 3rd edition of <em>effective C++</em> added some new items. So new posts will follow the third edition's arrangement. This item 0 is supposed to be item 1 in 3rd edition, but I just put it in front of the item 1 which I already wrote. After all, that's how programmers count :)</p>

<h1 id="intervals">Intervals</h1>
<ul>
<li>Perfect Intervals: 1(perfect unison), 4(perfect 4th), 5(perfect 5th), 8(perfect octave)</li>
<li>Major Intervals: 2(major 2nd), 3(major 3rd), 6(major 6th), 7(major 7th)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="scales">Scales</h1>
<ul>
<li>major scale (WWHWWWH)</li>
<li>natural minor scale / aeolian scale (WHWWHWW) = based off the 6th degree that shares the key signature of the major scale</li>
<li>harmonic minor scale(WHWWH1.5H) = natural minor + sharpened 7th degree</li>
<li>melodic minor scale(ASC:WHWWWWH, DESC:WWHWWHW) =  the ascending form of the scale has both a raised 6th and 7th degree, and the descending form of the scale reverts back to the natural minor scale form</li>
<li>chromatic scale(H*12) = constructed entirely of half steps or semitones.</li>
<li>wholetone scale(W*6) = constructed entirely of whole-steps or tones.</li>
<li>lydian scale(WWWHWWH) = based off the 4th degree of any major scale (C major scale from its fourth degree (F) -&gt; F lydian scale)</li>
<li>mixolydian scale(WWHWWHW) = based off the 5th degree of any major scale (C major scale from its fifth degree (G), -&gt; G mixolydian scale)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="chords">Chords</h1>
<ul>
<li>Tonic: the note considered to be the basis of the chord, e.g.: C, D, …</li>
<li>Quality
<ul>
<li>major chords = 1,3,5 notes of major scale, major 3rd followed by minor 3rd;</li>
<li>minor chords = 1,3,5 notes of minor scale, minor 3rd followed by major 3rd, same as a major chord but the third being lowered a semitone</li>
<li>diminished chords = similar to minor, but the top note (the fifth) is also flattened, minor 3rd followed by minor 3rd.</li>
<li>augmented chords = similar to major, but the top note (the fifth) is raised by a semitone, major 3rd followed by a major 3rd</li>
<li>dominat 7th chords = similar to major, with the addition of a flattened seventh above the root note of the chord (C Dominant 7th = C,E,G,bB); within a diatonic context, it’s based from the 5th/dominant of any major key, so in the key of C major, the dominant 7th chord starts on G (GBDF)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inversion: which note of the chord is placed at the bottom (root, 1st inversion, 2nd inversion)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="key-signatures">Key Signatures</h1>
<ul>
<li>Relative minor &amp; major keys: the sixth degree of the major key is the relative minor key, both share exactly the same key signature (C major -&gt; A minor); similarly, to find the relative major of a minor key = either count down 6 notes, or count up to the 3rd note.</li>
<li>To add a flat sign, count up four notes from root; to add a sharp, count up five notes.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="chord-progressions">Chord Progressions</h1>
<ul>
<li>Labelling:
<ul>
<li>C Major Root Position: C = I</li>
<li>C Major 1st Inversion: C/E = Ib = I6 = I6/3</li>
<li>C Major 2nd Inversion: C/G = Ic = I6/4</li>
<li>G7 1st Inversion: G7/B = Vb = V6/5</li>
<li>G7 2nd Inversion: G7/D = Vc = V4/3</li>
<li>G7 3rd Inversion: G7/F = Vd = V4/2</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="meter">Meter</h1>
<ul>
<li>Simple meters: the top number in the time signature is a 3 or divisible by 2 (e.g., 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 2/2, 3/2, 4/2).
<ul>
<li>4/4: simple quadruple, can be represented by a ‘C’, known as common time;</li>
<li>2/2 can be represented by ‘C’ with a vertical line through it, known as cut common time</li>
<li>2/4: simple duple meter. A bar consists of 2 crotchet beats</li>
<li>2/3: simple triple meter. A bar consists of 3 crotchet beats</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compound meters: top number in the time signature is divisible by 3, by a number greater than 1 (e.g., 6/8, 9/8, 12/8). The rhythmic value that is defined in the bottom number of the time signature, is grouped in 3s, which gives them distinct feel</li>
<li>Beams: lines that connect shorter note values and help to clearly display the main beats of a meter.</li>
<li>Grouping: as a general rule, the main beats of the meter must be clearly visible within the displayed rhythm at all times</li>
